## Introduction

Rust is a modern systems programming language that focuses on safety, performance, and concurrency. This repository is designed to assist beginners in learning Rust from scratch and advancing to more complex topics.

## Benefits of Rust

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency without Data Races**: The language prevents data races through its ownership and borrowing system, enabling safe concurrent programming.
- **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and emphasis on control over low-level details allow high performance.
- **Community and Tooling**: It has an active and supportive community with a growing ecosystem of libraries and excellent tooling.
